# Trading Skills — AI-Powered Market Analysis

Most retail traders juggle 5+ tabs — broker, charting platform, screener, news feed, spreadsheet — just to decide whether to enter a trade. This project collapses all of that into a single conversational interface powered by Claude.

Ask a question in plain English, get back real data: technicals, fundamentals, option Greeks, risk metrics, earnings dates, correlation matrices, and full PDF reports. Connect your Interactive Brokers account and it manages your portfolio too — finds roll candidates for expiring shorts, flags earnings risk, and generates action reports.

**Who is this for?**
- **Retail options traders** who sell premium, run PMCCs, or manage covered calls
- **Self-directed investors** who want quick fundamental + technical scans without switching tools
- **Python-literate traders** who want to extend the analysis with custom scripts
- **IBRK users** who want AI-assisted portfolio management

**Quick example** — scan for bullish setups and check PMCC viability:

```
You: Scan AAPL,MSFT,NVDA,GOOGL,AMZN for bullish trends, then check the top picks for PMCC suitability

Claude: [runs scanner-bullish → filters top scores → runs scanner-pmcc]
        NVDA: Bullish score 8/10, PMCC score 9.2/11 — LEAPS $95 call (Δ0.82),
        sell $140 call (Δ0.18), net debit $5,420, annual yield 47%...
```

**Another example** — correlation check before adding to a portfolio:

```
You: Show correlation for SPY,GOOG,NVDA,ZM,RTX,PFE,XOM

Claude: NVDA is the standout diversifier — near-zero correlation with everything.
        RTX/XOM at 0.86 — little diversification benefit between them.
```

![Spread analysis with POP metrics for SPY, QQQ, DIA](assets/analyze%20option%20spread%20strategies%20SPY,%20QQQ%20and%20DIA.png)

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) with third-party skills enabled (fully installed and authenticated)
- Optional: TWS or IB Gateway for portfolio features


## Two Ways to Use

### Claude Code / Cursor (Full Experience)

#### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/staskh/trading_skills.git
cd trading_skills
uv sync
```

Run Claude Code or Cursor in the repository root. All skills are available as interactive commands — ask questions about your IBKR portfolio, symbols, or companies of interest.

### MCP Server (Claude Desktop)

The MCP server is a lightweight alternative for use with Claude Desktop (including the free tier). It exposes 23 trading analysis tools directly to Claude Desktop without needing Claude Code.

#### Installation

1. Install the package (requires Python 3.12+):
   ```bash
   pip install trading-skills
   ```

2. Find the full path to the installed command:

   **macOS / Linux:**
   ```bash
   which trading-skills-mcp
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   where trading-skills-mcp
   ```
   If `where` doesn't find it, locate it manually:
   ```cmd
   python -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('scripts'))"
   ```
   The script will be `trading-skills-mcp.exe` in that directory (typically at `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<Version>\Scripts\`)

3. Open Claude Desktop, go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**:

   ![Claude Desktop Settings → Developer](assets/ClaudeDesktop-Settings-Developer.png)

   Add the following to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   **macOS / Linux:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "trading-skills": {
         "command": "/full/path/to/trading-skills-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "trading-skills": {
         "command": "C:\\full\\path\\to\\trading-skills-mcp.exe"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Replace the path with the output from step 2.

4. Restart Claude Desktop. Don't worry if you see an MCP error message — it will disappear once you try some of the examples below.

#### Installation from GitHub

   Add the following to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   **macOS / Linux:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "trading-skills": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/staskh/trading_skills.git", "trading-skills-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```json
   {

       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Sandbox Outputs (Not Committed)

Temporary reports, datasets, and notebooks are saved to `sandbox/` and are not committed to git. Report filenames include timestamps: `<name>_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.<ext>`.

## Interactive Brokers Setup

To use IB features:

1. Install [TWS](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php) or [IB Gateway](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-stable.php)
2. Enable API connections in TWS: Configure → API → Settings → Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients
3. Note the port: 7497 (paper) or 7496 (live)

## Massive (formerly Polygon.io) Setup

Whale-detection features (`option_whales`, `whales_hunter`) require a [Massive](https://massive.com/) API key (the platform was previously known as Polygon.io).

### Claude Code / Cursor

Create a `.env` file in the repository root:

```bash
MASSIVE_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here
```

The library loads it automatically via `python-dotenv`.

### MCP Server (Claude Desktop)

Pass the key through the `env` field in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**macOS / Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trading-skills": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/trading-skills-mcp",
      "env": {
        "MASSIVE_API_KEY": "your_massive_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trading-skills": {
      "command": "C:\\full\\path\\to\\trading-skills-mcp.exe",
      "env": {
        "MASSIVE_API_KEY": "your_massive_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The `env` block is merged with the system environment, so other variables are not affected.

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Lint
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run ruff format src/ tests/

# Test individual script
uv run python .claude/skills/fundamentals/scripts/fundamentals.py AAPL

# Debug MCP server with MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run python -m mcp_server.server
```

## Architecture

```
User Query → Claude Code/Desktop → Skill or MCP Tool → Python Script → Response
```

Skills are SKILL.md files in `.claude/skills/` that instruct Claude how to fetch and analyze data using Python scripts. Skill scripts live under `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/`, and progressive reference material belongs in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/references/`.

The MCP server (`mcp_server/server.py`) wraps the same Python scripts as tools for Claude Desktop via the FastMCP framework.
