# IB Account

Fetch account summary from Interactive Brokers.

## IB Connection

TWS or IB Gateway must be running locally with API enabled:
- **Paper trading** — port 7497
- **Live trading** — port 7496
- **`IB_PORT` env var** — default port when `--port` is omitted (e.g. `IB_PORT=4001` for a Gateway container). Precedence: `--port` flag > `IB_PORT` > built-in default. Set it in the shell or a `.env` file.

**Port fallback:** If the configured port fails, automatically retry on the other port.
If the retry succeeds, save to memory which account type worked (live/paper) and reuse it for all IB skill calls in this and future sessions — until the user explicitly asks for the other account.
If both ports fail, ask the user to verify that TWS or IB Gateway is running with API access enabled.

## Instructions

> **Note:** If `uv` is not installed or `pyproject.toml` is not found, replace `uv run python` with `python` in all commands below.

```bash
uv run python scripts/account.py [--port PORT] [--account ACCOUNT_ID] [--all-accounts]
```

## Arguments

- `--port` - IB port (default: 7497 for paper trading)
- `--account` - Specific account ID to fetch
- `--all-accounts` - Fetch summaries for all managed accounts

**Default behavior** (no flags): fetches the first managed account only.
**Always use `--all-accounts`** unless the user asks for a specific account.

## Output

Returns JSON with:
- `connected` - Whether connection succeeded
- `accounts` - List of account summaries, each with account ID, net liquidation, cash, buying power, etc.

If not connected, explain that TWS/Gateway needs to be running.

## Dependencies

- `ib-async`


## Timezone

All timestamps and time-based calculations must use the `America/New_York` timezone. All JSON output must include `generated_at` (NY time string) and `data_delay` fields.
